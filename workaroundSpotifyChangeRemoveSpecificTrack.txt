      # https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/Positions-field-in-JSON-body-is-ignored-when-removing-tracks/td-p/6044424
      # - this spotipy api is no longer working because position is being ignored by spotify:
      # - playlist_remove_specific_occurrences_of_items(playlist_id, items, snapshot_id=None)
      #   this spotipy api calls the spotify web api: delete /playlists/{playlist_id}/tracks

      # - this is a workaround to the remove specific track issue
      # - just send a list of position values instead of a list of track ids and a list of positions
      # - to implement this work around you must modify spotipy:client.py private server and public server
      #
      # - the following 9 line removal and 4 line addittion must be added to
      #     spotipy:client.py - def playlist_remove_specific_occurrences_of_items()
      # in 2 places:
      #      1) (private server) WA_SpotifyFinder\venv39\Lib\site-packages\spotipy\client.py
      #      2) (public server) /home/[username]/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/spotipy/client.py
